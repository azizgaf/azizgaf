<h1>About Me 🤙🏽</h1>

<b>Hello! I am an aerospace engineering graduate currently developing my programming and IT skills.

📖 I have maninly worked with scripting in Matlab for a range of applications from reading/manipulating large data sets to implementing numerical methods to solve equations. I am also proficient at Python which is the first programming language I learnt which grew my passion for programming through projects I completed using modules such as PyGame. 

🔭 I am currently learning PowerShell and its applications to improve my knowledge in cybersecurity.

🌟 Here is my portfolio of my recent personal projects.
