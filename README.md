<h1>About Me</h1>

<b>Hello! I am an aerospace engineering graduate currently developing my programming and IT skills.

I have maninly worked with scripting in Matlab to manipulate large data sets and carry out various calculations throughout my engineering course and career. I am also proficient at Python which is the first programming language I learnt. I am currently learning PowerShell and its applications to improve my knowledge in cybersecurity.

I recently created this portfolio to present my personal projects.
